## Introduction

NoSQL (Not Only SQL) is a type of database management system that provides a flexible and scalable approach to storing and retrieving data. Unlike traditional SQL databases, NoSQL databases do not rely on a fixed schema and can handle large amounts of unstructured data.

This repository aims to provide an overview of different types of NoSQL databases and their use cases.

## Types of NoSQL Databases

There are several types of NoSQL databases, including:

- Document databases (e.g., MongoDB)
- Key-value stores (e.g., Redis)
- Columnar databases (e.g., Cassandra)
- Graph databases (e.g., Neo4j)

Each type has its own strengths and weaknesses, and choosing the right database depends on the specific requirements of your project.

## Getting Started

To get started with NoSQL databases, you can follow the installation instructions provided in the respective documentation of each database. Additionally, you can find example code and usage guidelines in the [Examples](#examples) section of this repository.

## Examples

This repository provides examples of how to use different NoSQL databases. Each example includes code snippets and explanations to help you understand the concepts and get started with your own projects.

- [MongoDB Example](examples/mongodb-example.md)
- [Redis Example](examples/redis-example.md)
- [Cassandra Example](examples/cassandra-example.md)
- [Neo4j Example](examples/neo4j-example.md)

Feel free to explore these examples and adapt them to your own needs.
